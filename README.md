# BongoBotSlash
Bongo Bot Slash is a remake of a Discord Bot that I made which improves greatly on lots of the issues present in the original version of the bot. The main purpose of the bot is for playing a game known as "Give & Take", a game in which players are presented with a list of items (usually all being a part of a category of some sort such as colors, fruits, Taylor Swift albums, etc.) each with a set amount of points at the start. When the player is not on cooldown, they may take an action to take 1 point away from one item and give it to another. Once an item reaches 0 points, it is removed from the game entirely and cannot be brought back. This continues until a certain number of items are left, at which point a final vote is started which polls users on which of the remaining items they want to win. Once the vote has completed, the item with the most votes is crowned the winner.

## Running the Bot

To run the bot follow these steps:
